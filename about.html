        <p>
          We wanted to decorate our small Chicago apartment.
          We liked some of the art we owned,
          but we knew it wouldn't work for two reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <strong><li>No theme or cohesion</li></strong>
          <strong><li>We're easily bored</li></strong>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This got us thinking: how do we keep our space looking nice and feeling new?
          We want our space to have a consistent look,
          but we also want that look to change over time.
          Can we do this in an affordable way?

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your child's dorm room</li>
          <li>Your office</li>
          <li>Your classroom</li>
          <li>Your future nursery</li>
          <li>and we're sure there's more!</li>
