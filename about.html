  <h1 class="title is-1">The problem</h1>
  <p>
    We wanted to decorate our small Chicago apartment.
    We liked some of the art we owned,
    but we knew it wouldn't work for two reasons:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li class="has-text-weight-bold">No theme or cohesion</li>
    <li class="has-text-weight-bold">We're easily bored</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This got us thinking: how do we keep our space looking nice and feeling new?
    We want our space to have a consistent look,
    but we also want that look to change over time.
    Can we do this in an affordable way?
  </p>
