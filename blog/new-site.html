    Apples for Dinner is a small team,
    so we actually listen to each person that takes the time to write to us.
    Most people love the idea — curated art every season (what's not to love?).
    After hearing the idea,

    So far this change has helped people
    <strong>
      visualize what their space might look like with art
    </strong>.
    We love hearing from you, so please continue to tell us what you think!
    Does the new site help you visualize your space?
    Are there more image categories you'd like to see in
    <a href="/profile">our quiz</a>?
    Our ears (and inboxes) are open.
