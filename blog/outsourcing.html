  What parts of your life are time-consuming, distracting, and boring? For me, this list includes washing the dishes and researching items I plan to buy. I often think “what if I could get rid of this list?” How would I spend that time? How would I feel without that stress?

  Outsourcing is often considered a tool for businesses. Businesses that outsource delegate jobs or services to a third party. Unfortunately, individuals don’t often adopt this mindset. I’ve enjoyed my recent experiments with outsourcing with daily life — and I think you will too!

  You can delegate almost anything... Responding to emails. Buying birthday gifts. Most tasks done via computer or phone are tasks that someone else could do for you.
