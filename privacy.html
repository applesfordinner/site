      This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from <a href="https://applesfordinner.com">applesfordinner.com</a> (the “Site”).

    <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

    When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.

We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”

    We collect Device Information using the following technologies:

    Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
    When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.
    We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
